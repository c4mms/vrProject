# Virtual Try-On E-Shop (Demo)
## Description
This project is a web-based demo for an innovative e-commerce experience that allows users to try on clothes in Virtual Reality (VR) before purchasing.
It combines a traditional online shopping layout with VR technology to enhance user engagement and shopping confidence.

## Features
- Standard e-commerce interface (homepage, collections, product pages).

- "Try on in VR" button next to each product ("Add to Cart" button).

- 3D clothing models designed in Blender.

- VR try-on experience integrated via an iframe embedding the models/scenes.

## Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourname/yourproject.git
Open index.html (and other pages) directly in the browser, or host it using a local server (for example, using VSCode Live Server).

Make sure the VR experience URLs/frames are correctly linked and accessible.

## Usage
Browse the site like a normal online shop.

Click the "Try on in VR" button next to any item to launch the VR preview.

The VR experience allows users to view the clothing item in a virtual space (optimized for headset display).

Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the website.

Blender for 3D model creation.

WebXR and iframe embedding for VR integration.

## Future Improvements (Ideas)
- Full-body avatar customization for more realistic try-on experience.

- Direct integration with VR headsets (Meta Quest, HTC Vive).

- Size fitting and AR (Augmented Reality) mobile try-ons.

- Improved VR scene interactions (like walking around, rotating, scaling).
